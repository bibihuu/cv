My research focuses on unravelling the complex geochemical behaviours of elements in magmatic-hydrothermal systems. It integrates advanced synchrotron in-situ X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) techniques, thermodynamic modelling, and numerical simulations to investigate the mechanisms of ore formation under geological conditions, pushing the boundaries of current understanding in this field. My works aim to address pivotal topics such as iron and critical minerals behaviour in hydrothermal systems. These studies have not only contributed to academic knowledge but also offered insights relevant to the exploration and extraction of mineral resources.

My work is characterized by a strong interdisciplinary approach, blending geochemistry, mineralogy, and computational methods. By applying machine learning techniques to mineralogical datasets, I aim to uncover patterns that would otherwise remain hidden in traditional analyses, further driving forward the understanding of metallogenic processes. I am passionate about advancing the frontiers of economic geology and look forward to contributing further to the scientific community through both theoretical and practical innovations.
