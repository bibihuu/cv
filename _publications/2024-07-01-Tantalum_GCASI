The timescale of the formation of giant hydrothermal gold deposits varies from protracted episodic systems lasting ≥45 Myr in Archean orogenic deposits, to rapid (<0.06 Myr) deposition in modern magmatic hydrothermal settings. However, the time-constrained changes in fluid sources and metal enrichment remain poorly known. Here we used multiple high resolution in-situ approaches to decode the absolute age of mineralization and the source of fluids in the world-class Mesozoic Huangjindong and Wangu gold-tungsten deposits in South China. We find that these laminated veins formed over 60 Myr, with fluid sources evolving from CO<sub>2</sub>-rich magmatic-hydrothermal (155 Ma; δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>fluid</sub> = 6.5 to 13.3‰) to mixed magmatic and meteoric waters (125 Ma; δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>fluid</sub> = 0.9 to 6.6‰), and finally to CO2-poor meteoric water with mantle components (95 Ma; δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>fluid</sub> = -3.0 to 2.3‰, <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He = 0.04 to 0.37 Ra). The two early magmatic-dominated events resulted mainly in W-mineralization, whereas gold was introduced during the final stage. These Au-bearing fluids contrast with the CO<sub>2</sub>-rich metamorphic and magmatic fluids characteristic of many mesozonal lode gold deposits. These results demonstrate that long-lived plumbing system capable of channeling fluids over several 10’s of millions of years are not restricted to the Precambrian, and that meteoric waters heated and circulated by upwelling asthenosphere under extensional tectonic settings are capable of forming giant gold deposits. We emphasize that protracted hydrothermal flow, polymetallic metal accumulations, and Earth evolution can be synchronously monitored from ore deposit formation perspective.
