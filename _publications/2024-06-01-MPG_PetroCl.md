Multiple metamorphic buried-hill hydrocarbon reservoirs have been recently discovered in the Bozhong Depression, Bohai Bay Basin. Among them, the buried-hill reservoirs in the BZ13, BZ19 and BZ26 regions have the largest condensate gas reserve in eastern China. The hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir has a large thickness with a maximum of ∼1 km, making the oil-equivalent reserve exceed 5 × 108 tons. This study used petrography, isotopes, gas composition, zircon U–Pb geochronology, X-ray diffraction, electronic probe and hydrothermal dissolution experiments to discuss the formation mechanisms of the metamorphic buried-hill reservoirs. The results indicate that the reservoirs 500 m below the surface of the buried hill have been significantly altered by the mantle-derived CO2. This is supported by the carbon isotope of CO2, He isotope of the helium gas, strong negative excursions in δ18OPDB, positive excursions in δ13CPDB, Co/Ni ratio greater than 1 in pyrite and secondary characteristic minerals such as dawsonite. Hydrothermal dissolution experiments using CO2 result in the precipitation of kaolinite, ankerite and quartz cements, which is consistent with petrographic observation. The mantle-derived CO2 reacts with feldspars, hornblende, biotite and carbonates, creates secondary dissolution pores and significantly improves reservoir quality. Moreover, partial carbonate cements exhibit negative excursions in δ13CPDB and the depletion of light rare earth elements, indicating the influence of organic acids-bearing low-temperature hydrothermal fluids. Therefore, three development models illustrating the formation of metamorphic buried-hill reservoirs were proposed. This study may serve as a reference for the hydrocarbon exploration in metamorphic buried-hill reservoirs.
