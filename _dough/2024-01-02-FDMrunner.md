Generate and optimise FDMNES input files for predicting crystal structures through batch spectrum simulations and spectral comparison. By adjusting bond lengths and angles within specified ranges, the code streamlines parallel FDMNES calculations and identifies the structure that most possible matches experimental XANES spectra.
